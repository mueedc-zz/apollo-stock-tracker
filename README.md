# Apollo Stock Tracker

## About

The Apollo Stock Tracker application is meant for users to track their stock portfolios. The main function of the application is to send emails to users when their stocks have dropped below a certain percetange that they themselves have set. This email is meant to notify the user that the specific stock has dropped in price and selling should be in the forefront of their minds.

The app also tracks the highest market price of the stock since the purchase price and whether the stock has dropped a certain percentage since the high price. This could indicate to a user that the stock needs to be examined and whether selling should be the next move. Stock information is retrieved from the Yahoo Finance API.

## Start

`npm run start-dev` or `yarn start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also `npm run (yarn) start-server` and `npm run (yarn) build-client`.
